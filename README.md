# Processing-demos
# Goal
The goal of this project isu to learn how to assemble complex objects out of simple parts. We use the matrix stack for this. This is part one (model) of a two-part project. For this first project 2A, you will create one 3D model of a car. Then during the second part (2B), you will incorporate this object into a 3D animated scene. The latter part of the project (scene)uses  transformations and camera position to create an animated scene.

# Tools
The project is written in processing using the python syntax. Download the build executable files in the "model" and "scene" folders.
